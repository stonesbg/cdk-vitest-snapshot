# cdk-vitest-snapshot

Purpose of this repo is to test a few key concepts:

- utilization of [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with cdk instead of using Jest
- usage of snapshot through vitest but also using snapshot serializers in order to control the output from serialization
- Introductions of [Nx](https://nx.dev/)
